This project is a simple 2D shooter game developed using Python and Pygame, where players control a character to shoot and eliminate enemies. The game features basic enemy AI, where enemies spawn at random positions and move downward. Players can move left and right while dodging enemies and shooting bullets. The game implements collision detection, scoring, and a game-over screen with a restart option. It showcases essential game development concepts, including event handling, object interactions, and animations. Future improvements may include additional enemy types, power-ups, and enhanced difficulty settings for a more engaging experience.
